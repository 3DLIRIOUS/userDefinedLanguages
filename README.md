# Notepad++ User Defined Languages Collection

Notepad++ supports around 80 programming languages for syntax highlighting & folding. If your beloved programming language is not in the supported language list, you may find it here. 

To learn all about User Defined Languages:

## Using one of these User Defined Languages

For now, you have to manually install a new User Defined Language (UDL).

1. Download the XML file(s) from the [`UDLs`](./UDLs) folder of [this Collection](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/userDefinedLanguages).
2. Import the file(s) either by placing the file(s) in your `userDefineLangs` folder and restarting Notepad++, or by using the User Defined Language dialog box to **Import** your file(s).  More details of what those steps entail can be found in the ["Import a UDL" section](https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/user-defined-language-system/#import-a-udl) of the official documentation.

## Submitting your User Defined Language to the repository

If you have a User Defined Language XML file that you would like to share with the world, you can submit a Pull Request to add it to the Collection.  The team will review your submission, and either merge it into the Collection, ask for clarification or fixes, or reject the submission.

To be accepted, your submission _must_ meet the following **requirement**s and _should_ meet the following **recommendations**
1. **requirement**: The language being described by the UDL shoud be of reasonably-general interest.  
   * Example: a UDL for a Markdown variant would be of general interest
   * Example: a UDL for the programming language that you invented for your computer science class that only you and a few classmates will use is not likely of general interest (unless you happen to have invented the Next Big Language).
2. **requirement**: The XML file must be given a unique name. (described below)
